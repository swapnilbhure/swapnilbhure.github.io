5. Chalmers university OpenFoam course material. very good.

    [PhD course in CFD with OpenSource software, Quarter 2, 2008](http://www.tfd.chalmers.se/~hani/kurser/OS_CFD_2008/)

6. Syntaxes of functions and expressions in OpenFOAM like exp, sqrt. pos(x), etc.

    [OpenFOAM](https://www.openfoam.com/documentation/guides/latest/doc/openfoam-guide-expression-syntax.html)

7. Lot of great OpenFOAM CFD tutorials, book, videos, etc.

    Basic tutorial and even written text guide is very good. well organised content. Holzmann has also written a book on OpenOFAM.

    [Numerical Solutions - OpenFOAM Knowledge Base](https://holzmann-cfd.com/)

8. Resources by OpenFOAM Foundation: Includes C++ source guide, technical guide, training and user guide.

    C++ source guide is the most imp thing here.
