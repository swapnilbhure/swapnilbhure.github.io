I am a PhD student in <a href="https://materials.iisc.ac.in/">Materials Engineering Department</a> at <a href="https://www.iisc.ac.in/">Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore</a>.

I am working on *multi-scale computational modelling, simulation and experimental study of metal additive manufacturing process* in <a href="https://materialsmodellinggroup.github.io/">Materials Modelling Group</a> under <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Abhik-Choudhury-2/">Prof Abhik Choudhury</a>. The aim of my study is to produce single-crystal CMSX-4 (Ni-based superalloy) parts using additive manufacturing.
