##### Modelling and Simulation in Materials Engineering
###### Course Instructor: Prof Abhik Choudhury

This is an elective course open to BS, MS, MTech and PhD students at IISc. This semester there are about 25 students in the class from various departments like Materials Engineering, Center for Product Design and Manufacturing, Inter-disciplinary Center for Water Research, etc.

I have conducted 13+ hours of Python coding tutorials and assisting the course instructor in organizing the course. I also helped students with their course related queries.

Conducting tutorials has helped improve my own understanding of the course. It has helped me teach the concepts in simple understable and organized way. Overall the student feedback about the tutorials has been good as it helped them apply and visualise the concepts.
